# Lg - Context logger backed by Logrus, including a structured HTTP RequestLogger

The `lg` ("log") package is a `context`-based application logger built on the Logrus package
(https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus). It also includes a HTTP request logging middleware, `lg.RequestLogger`.

See the [example](_example/main.go) for a sample program.
